At Black Sand Solutions, I worked as an Software Engineer intern along with other interns, creating and contirbuting to various projects assigned to us, expanding our hands-on experience and skills.

As an intern, I had to work learn and apply computer vision to our program in order to track Anti-Satellite (ASAT) Launchers. To achieve this, I had to create a syntehtic dataset, train AI models to accurately detect these launchers in order to protect our satellites. 

Additionally, I created a program that simulated different type of maneuvers on satellites in real time. This program lets users assign maneuver goals, track its performance, and visualize the maneuver's feasibility and execution.
