At Interstel Technologies, I worked as a GUI Desing Intern, helping modernize Star Fleet: Krellan Commander II, a classic space strategy game. My role focued on creating an updated user interface that improved it's usability while maintianing the game's original design.

As an intern, I desgined wireframes and prototypes to explore new layouts, then implemented the redesigned interface into the game. With constant communication with our mentor, we always ensure we are able to captivate his vision and display his ideas on our ptotoypes. Additionally, we wanted to make sure the player is able to easily read and understand out layout, adding quality of life features.

This experience strengthened my skills in UI/UX design, prototyping, and teamwork. It taught me how to translate creative visions into a functional design, and how impactful interface choices can improve user engagement and accessbility.
