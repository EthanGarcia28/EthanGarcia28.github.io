## Internship Overview

During my internship at Interstel Technologies, I worked as a GUI Design Intern on the modernization of _Star Fleet II: Krellan Commander_, a classic space strategy game. Over the course of six weeks, I collaborated with a team of interns to redesign and rebuild the gameâ€™s user interface, enhancing usability while remaining faithful to the original design.

## UI Redesign & Prototyping

I created wireframes and prototypes using Figma to explore different layout options. These prototypes were iteratively refined based on feedback from our mentor and team members. I implemented interactive buttons, menus, and visual elements into the game, ensuring that all components function and are aligned with gameplay mechanics. I also focused on improving user readability and navigation, adding features that allowed players to understand the interface and access key game functions quickly.

## Design Process & Collaboration

Throughout the internship, I participated in a team-based, iterative design process, collaborating closely with other interns and our mentor. Each prototype went through multiple rounds of testing and feedback, allowing us to refine visuals and functionality. This process taught me the importance of communication, compromise, and iteration in design projects.

## Skills & Takeaways

This experience strengthened my skills in UI/UX design, Figma prototyping, and teamwork. I learned how to translate creative visions into functional interfaces, implement interactive features, and improve user engagement and accessibility through thoughtful design.
