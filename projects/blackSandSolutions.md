## Internship Overview

In the summer of 2025, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Black Sand Solutions along with a team of other interns. Together, we contributed to projects focused on satellite security and space situational awareness. My role involved combining software development, computer vision, and orbital mechanics to create tools that could detect potential threats and simulate satellite behavior in real time.

## ASAT Detection

One of my main projects was applying computer vision to track Anti-Satellite (ASAT) launchers. To do this, I created a synthetic dataset and trained object detection models to accurately identify the launchers. This gave me hands-on experience with machine learning, dataset generation, and applying AI methods to a real-world security problem.

## Satellite Maneuver Simulation
I also developed a Python program that simulated different satellite maneuvers, such as Hohmann transfers and inclination changes. The program lets users assign maneuver goals, monitor performance in real time, and visualize the feasibility and execution of the maneuvers. This project allowed me to connect orbital mechanics concepts with programming to build practical tools for maneuver planning, collision avoidance, and threat detection

## Skills & Takeaways
Through this internship, I strengthened my skills in Python programming, computer vision, AI model training, and orbital mechanics. I also gained experience building simulations and AI tools that contribute to space security by predicting satellite maneuvers and identifying potential threats.
