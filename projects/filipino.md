## Project Overview

For this project, I researched and wrote a 22-page paper titled _Corruption, Colonization, and the American Dream: Mapping Filipino Migration under Empire_. The paper examined how U.S. imperialism and colonial influence shaped Filipino migration during the 19th and 20th centuries. I focused on the intersections of militarism, poverty, corruption, racism, and the pursuit of the American Dream, showing how these forces not only pushed Filipinos to migrate but also structured their experiences once in the United States.

## Research & Methodology

In developing the paper, I engaged with a wide range of scholarly texts, including Dylan Rodríguez's _Suspended Apocalypse_, Vernadette Vicuña Gonzalez's _Militarism_, and Shona N. Jackson's _Colonialism_, among others. I synthesized these works with historical accounts and migration studies to create a cohesive argument about the enduring legacies of empire. Additionally, I connected this research to my own family's history, reflecting on how my Mom and Grandpa personally felt the impacts of U.S. influence in the Philippines, leaving behind lasting changes to their lives and future opportunities.

## Reflection & Skills

Ultimately, this project not only deepened my understanding of Filipino migration as part of a broader history of U.S. Empire and colonialism but also allowed me to see the ways these forces continue to shape families across generations. Through the process, I strengthened my skills in critical research, academic writing, and connecting theory with lived experience, and these skills continue to influence my academic and professional growth.
