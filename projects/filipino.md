For this project, I researched and wrote a 22 page paper titled _Corruption, Colonization, and the American Dream: Mapping Filipino Migration under Empire_. The paper examed how U.S. imperialism and colonial influence shaped Filipino migration during the 19th and 20th centuries. I Focused on the intersections of militarism, poverty, corruption, racism, and the pursuit of the American Dream, showing how these forces not only pushed Filipinos to migrate but also structured their experiences once in the United States.

In developing the paper, I engaged with a wide ranged of scholarly texts, including Dylan Rodríguez's _Suspended Apocalypse_, Vernadette Vicuña Gonzalez's _Militarism_, and Shona N. Jackson's _Colonialism_, among others. I synthesized these works with histroical accounts and migration studies to create a cohesive argument about the enduring legacies of empire. Additionally, I connected this research to my own family's history, reflecting on how my Mom and Grandpa personally felt the impacts of U.S. influence in the Philippines, leaving behind lasting changes to their lives and future opportunities.

Ultimately, this project not only deepened my understanding of Filipino migration as part of a broader history of U.S. empire, and colonialism but also allowed me to see the ways these forces continue to chape families across generations. through the process, I stregthened my skills in critical research, academic writing, and connecting theory with lived experience, and these skills continue to influence my acdemic and professional growth.
