## How I Got Started

Ewa Makai Middle School is the place that would mark the beginning of my pursuit of software engineering. Fascinated by video games and inspired by content creators creating robots, programs, and fun tech projects, it was the fuel that would spark my interest in programming. When I took my first coding class and built my first-ever game, it was an unmatched feeling that I chased, being able to bring concepts to life, which led to my current position in programming and software engineering.

## Why Computer Science?

Since that first coding class, my interest in computer science has deepened, questioning the limits of what kind of projects I am capable of completing. From solving algorithmic problems in my previous classes, I’m intrigued by the process of creating websites and projects in general, as it’ll not only challenge me critically but will also help develop the mindset of a software engineer, who is constantly creating solutions to problems. This problem-solving aspect of programming and creating projects with purpose are the biggest reasons why I want to have a career in this field.

## My Goals

But first, in order to achieve these goals, there is a set of skills I hope to gain through this class and enhance throughout my college career. I want to expand my knowledge on multiple coding languages like JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. These languages will be essential in creating websites and building real-life applications that people can use. In addition to this, I also want to strengthen my programming skills overall. I hope to be able to use my knowledge that I learned from my previous classes, like ICS 212 and ICS 211, and apply those concepts and skills to this class to create meaningful projects. My goal is to take my programming to the next level by having the ability to develop meaningful projects that serve a purpose.
