## I. Introduction

The role of artificial intelligence in education, particularly in software engineering, can be viewed in two very different ways: as a powerful learning tool or as an obstacle that can hinder long-term skill development. Throughout ICS 314, I primarily used AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to assist with coding tasks, debugging, and understanding difficult concepts. As the coursework increased in complexity and time pressure, these tools became more appealing to rely on. While AI helped me complete assignments more efficiently and avoid costly errors, it also raised questions about how much I was truly learning versus how much I was relying on automation.

## II. Personal Experience with AI

### 1. Experience WODs

During Experience WODs, I used AI sparingly. Most of the time, I attempted to complete the tasks on my own and only turned to AI when I did not understand how to complete a specific part of the exercise. In these cases, AI was mainly used for clarification or debugging rather than for generating complete solutions.


### 2. In-class Practice WODs

I made limited use of AI during in-class Practice WODs. I primarily relied on ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to verify my code, debug issues, or get ideas on how to approach a task. While this helped me finish assignments more quickly, there were times when I used AI to solve parts of the problem that I did not fully understand.



### 3. In-class WODs

In contrast to Experience and Practice WODs, I relied heavily on AI during in-class WODs. Due to strict time limits and grading policies, I felt pressured to use AI to ensure correctness. To maintain a good grade, I often used AI to debug my code and fix small errors rather than taking the time to fully understand the underlying issues.



### 4. Essays

For essays in this course, AI was only used for grammar and spell checking. I did not rely on AI to generate content, as I wanted my reflections to accurately represent my own experiences and opinions.



### 5. Final Project

AI played a significant role in my final project. I typically wrote the initial code myself, but when I encountered complex bugs or unfamiliar features, I used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for assistance. AI was especially helpful during debugging, as some errors were difficult for me to understand. Having Copilot explain what was going wrong helped me resolve issues more efficiently.


### 6. Learning a Concept / Tutorial

I generally did not use AI for tutorials because solution videos were provided. However, if a concept or method was not clearly explained in the video, I used ChatGPT to gain a better understanding. This was particularly helpful for more complex ideas that required additional explanation.



### 7. Answering a Question in Class or on Discord

I did not use AI to answer questions in class or on Discord, mainly because I rarely answered questions in these settings.



### 8. Asking or Answering a Smart Question

I did not use AI when asking or answering smart questions. When I did have questions, I felt confident in my ability to explain them clearly without AI assistance.



### 9. Coding Example

I never used AI to find coding examples. Most examples were easy to find online through forums, documentation, or videos, making AI unnecessary for this purpose.



### 10. Explaining Code

When trying to understand existing code, I usually attempted to analyze it on my own first. If I still did not understand it, I would ask ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot to explain what the code was doing.



### 11. Writing Code

I typically wrote my own code, but when bugs or logic errors occurred, I used GitHub Copilot to help identify the issue. For more complex tasks that I did not fully understand, I sometimes used Copilot to generate starter code to help me get started.



### 12. Documenting Code

I usually documented my code myself by adding comments to explain different sections. However, there were times when I asked GitHub Copilot to help generate documentation when I struggled to explain something clearly.



### 13. Quality Assurance

When checking my code, I always made an effort to debug it myself first. If I reached a point where I was stuck, I relied on AI to explain errors or suggest fixes. This was especially helpful for understanding error messages and resolving issues more efficiently.



### 14. Other Uses in ICS 314 Not Listed

I did not find any additional uses of AI in ICS 314 beyond those already listed.

## III. Impact on Learning and Understanding

Although AI was helpful overall, it negatively impacted my learning experience in some ways. Relying on AI made it easier to bypass difficult problem-solving steps, which prevented me from fully developing certain skills. While AI helped me complete assignments successfully, it reduced the amount of deep learning that occurred. In situations like in-class WODs, I felt pressured to use AI to protect my grade, even if it meant sacrificing understanding.

---

## IV. Practical Applications

Outside of ICS 314, AI is commonly used in hackathons and personal or collaborative coding projects. In these environments, AI can be very effective at generating and debugging code quickly, allowing tasks to be completed efficiently. However, relying too heavily on AI can limit skill development and negatively impact performance in real-world scenarios such as coding reviews.

---

## V. Challenges and Opportunities

One major challenge I encountered with AI was that it sometimes generated incorrect solutions for complex problems. When I tried to correct it, AI would often repeat similar mistakes, creating an unproductive loop. While AI offers strong support for debugging and efficiency, it can also limit learning if used as a replacement for critical thinking rather than a supplement.

---

## VI. Comparative Analysis

Compared to traditional teaching methods, AI-enhanced learning offers speed and convenience but can reduce engagement and knowledge retention. Traditional approaches force students to work through problems and understand concepts more deeply, while AI-assisted approaches prioritize efficiency. In my experience, relying too much on AI weakened my motivation and practical skill development.

---

## VII. Future Considerations

AI will continue to play a major role in software engineering education. However, it is important to find a balance in how it is integrated. While AI is a valuable support tool, its overuse can harm student learning. Future courses should encourage students to attempt problems independently before seeking assistance from AI.

---

## VIII. Conclusion

Overall, my experience using AI in ICS 314 was mixed. Tools like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot helped streamline my workflow and resolve difficult bugs, but they also reduced my engagement and depth of learning. AI should be used as a supplementary resource rather than a primary solution. Encouraging students to engage with material first and rely on AI second would lead to a more meaningful learning experience.
